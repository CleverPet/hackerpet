/**
  Eating The Food
  ===============

    The goal of this challenge is to help your player get comfortable with the
    Hubâ€™s sounds and movements.

    The Hub's dish will rotate out and offer a free foodtreat to your player at
    varying intervals. If your player does not take the foodtreat, the dish will
    stay out for progressively longer periods of time.

    **Challenge logic**: This challenge has 6 levels with 6 corresponding
    foodtreat offer durations. A foodtreat is automatically offered to the
    player for the corresponding time. If the foodtreat isn't eaten the level is
    increased and the offer duration will be extended. If the foodtreat was
    eaten the level will go down and presentation time will be shortened. If 3
    foodtreats were eaten in the previous 5 interactions, the challenge is
    completed and the performance array will be reset.
