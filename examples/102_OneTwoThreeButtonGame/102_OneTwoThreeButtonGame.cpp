/*
 *  OneTwoThreeButtons
 *  ==================
 *
 *  This is game that can be useful during initial training of a dog or a cat
 *  to use the Hub. Given the animal onboarding ordering of:
 *
 *  1 Getting comfortable
 *  2 Getting curious
 *  3 Touching the touchpads
 *  4 Seeing the lights
 *
 *  .. this challenge is most useful for phases 2-4. In particular, setting all
 *  three touchpads to "on" during phases 2 and 3 can be useful, and setting 2
 *  of 3 touchpads to on can be useful for phases 3 and 4.
