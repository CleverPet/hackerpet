## Contributing

This is where things can get really fun. Want to add a new game, and perhaps
see how the community, or dogs, or cats, respond to it? Create your own fork
and submit a pull request. We'll chat about it as a community, and if it seems
sensible we'll add it to the collection of games! 

To make this work, all contributors first have to sign the [CleverPet
Individual Contributor License Agreement
(CLA)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXAajtFZpQ0VtHK2APtfzrA5w8DMNagJhCfLVr6h9lCQgj1g/viewform),
which is based on the Google CLA. This agreement provides the CleverPet team
with a license to re-distribute your contributions. After you sign, we'll add
you to the group that enables you to submit pull requests, etc.

Whenever possible, please follow these contribution guidelines:

- Keep each pull request small and focused on a single game, feature, or bug
  fix.
- Familiarize yourself with the code base, and follow the formatting principles
  adhered to in the surrounding code.
